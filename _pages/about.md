Welcome to my multifaceted digital space. You'll find not only my professional portfolio but also a canvas for my personal tech endeavors, reflective musings, and spontaneous thoughts. Currently as a Risk Analyst at American Express, I specialize in data analysis and decision science, crafting solutions to ensure smooth business operations. With a B.Tech. in Information Technology from IIEST Shibpur and an M.Tech. in Computer Science from ISI Kolkata, I possess strong technical skills and a passion for data-driven insights. I excel in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analysis tools, creating robust models for actionable strategies. I enjoy algorithmic problem-solving and thrive on innovative solutions.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I engage in writing technical blogs, exploring culinary adventures, and immersing myself in captivating narratives through web series and non-fiction reads. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of technology, data, and problem-solving together!
