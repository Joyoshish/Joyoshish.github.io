Here's a bit about my journey so far:

üíº Current Role: I am currently working as an Analyst at American Express. In this dynamic role, I leverage data analysis and decision science to provide invaluable insights to the business. My primary focus is on creating risk-free enterprise solutions that enable smooth transactions and seamless business processes.

üéì Education: I hold a B.Tech. in Information Technology from IIEST Shibpur, where I laid the foundation of my technical skills and developed a strong understanding of Computer Science. Subsequently, I pursued my M.Tech. in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science from ISI Kolkata. This journey not only enriched my knowledge but also ignited my passion for data-driven insights.

üß† Expertise: My core expertise lies in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have a knack for building and validating robust models that turn data into actionable insights. My deep understanding of the statistical and mathematical principles behind machine learning empowers me to make data-driven decisions effectively.

üíª Programming Skills: I am proficient in C++ and Python, which are my go-to languages for developing cutting-edge solutions. Whether it's implementing algorithms or crafting elegant code, I enjoy the creative process of solving technical challenges.

üîç Problem-Solving: I possess a high level of quantitative aptitude and a strong analytical mindset. I thrive in algorithmic problem-solving scenarios, relishing the opportunity to tackle intricate challenges head-on.

üåê Hobbies: Outside of the professional realm, I have a diverse set of hobbies. I find joy in writing technical blogs about Data Science ([Medium](https://medium.com/@joyoshish)) and subjects related to the GATE Computer Science exam ([GATE_CSE_BY_JS](https://gatecsebyjs.github.io/)). This not only allows me to share knowledge but also fosters continuous learning. Additionally, I'm a culinary enthusiast who loves to experiment in the kitchen, whipping up delectable dishes. And when it's time to unwind, you'll often find me binge-watching web series, exploring new narratives and perspectives.

ü§ù Let's Connect: I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, discussing innovative ideas, and exploring potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you share my enthusiasm for technology, data, and problem-solving.
